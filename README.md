# Theta

A red baby dragon born in the depths of ZERO Network.

She's a rare specimen of the Hexatesserasaurus species.
Her unique body is comprised of cascading hexagonal plates that provide power and flexibility.
Despite her frightening appearance, Theta's a peaceful creature.
One day she'll learn to breathe fire, just to warm our hearts.

Theta's been hooked on synthwave funk ever since she was born into the world of digital art.
She's here to share the vibe with you.
